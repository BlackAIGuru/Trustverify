I want you to help me build a full-stack web application called TrustVerify. This platform helps individuals and businesses protect themselves from fraud and scam during online transactions by offering services like identity verification, escrow payments, scam reporting, and behavioral fraud detection.

Please follow the instructions and requirements below to build this app from the frontend to backend, including database, API routes, security, and testing.

✅ 1. General Stack Requirements
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Auth: Firebase Auth or JWT-based custom auth
Hosting: Replit-compatible setup (but use Vercel-friendly code structure if possible)
Testing: Jest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend
Environment: Use .env file for secrets
API Structure: RESTful routes with secure middlewares
Code Structure: Modular MVC pattern for clarity and scalability
✅ 2. Frontend Requirements (React + Tailwind)
Create responsive React components for:

Landing Page
Hero section with CTA
Features overview
“Verify Transaction”, “Report Scam”, and “Sign Up” buttons
User Auth Pages

Admin Routes

Fraud Detection (NLP Placeholder)
Simulate fraud score calculation using simple rule-based logic for MVP
Add function analyzeTransactionChat() for future LLM/NLP integration
✅ 4. Database Schema (MongoDB via Mongoose)
Define Mongoose models for:

User
Name, Email, PasswordHash, Role, KYCStatus, TrustScore, CreatedAt
Transaction
BuyerID, SellerID, Terms, Status, Amount, EscrowStatus, CreatedAt
ScamReport
ReporterID, ReportedID, Description, EvidenceLinks, Status, CreatedAt
ChatLog (optional for NLP)

✅ 5. Security and Best Practices
Use bcrypt to hash passwords
Use JWT for sessions if not using Firebase
Apply rate limiting on login and form submission
Validate all inputs using Joi or express-validator
CORS handling and secure headers via helmet
Store secrets in .env file (e.g., JWT_SECRET, DB_URI)
✅ 6. Testing
Implement testing with:

Jest and Supertest for API routes
React Testing Library for frontend forms (login, KYC, transaction)
Include at least:
Unit test for trust score function
Integration test for escrow flow
Form validation test on scam report submission
✅ 7. Bonus (Optional Placeholder)
Mock integration with:
KYC service (Onfido/Sumsub)
Stripe Connect for escrow
IP geolocation API (flag location mismatch)
