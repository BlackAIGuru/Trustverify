1. API Key Generation Flow
Step 1 – Developer Registration

Developer/partner signs up on the Developer Portal.

Completes KYC/AML verification for compliance.

Selects Industry Category (Fintech, Payments, e-Commerce, iGaming, etc.).

Accepts API Terms of Service (includes permitted use cases per industry).

Step 2 – Application Profile Creation

Developers create an Application Profile for each product/service they’re integrating TrustVerify with.

Information captured:

App Name & Description

Industry type & regulatory category

Callback URLs & IP whitelist

Expected transaction volume (to suggest correct pricing tier)

Required modules (e.g., KYC verification, Escrow, Trust Scoring, Fraud Signals, etc.)

Step 3 – API Key Issuance

System generates:

Public Key (for client-side SDK usage)

Secret Key (server-side only, shown once)

Keys are environment-specific:

Sandbox Key – for testing in our sandbox environment.

Production Key – for live operations (requires extra approval & compliance checks).

2. Industry-Specific Key Scopes

Each industry gets a scoped API key with permissions aligned to compliance rules:

Industry	Key Permissions	Example Endpoints Enabled
Fintech	KYC/AML, Transaction Monitoring, Fraud Scoring	/kyc/verify, /transaction/check, /trustscore/get
Payments	Transaction Risk Checks, Escrow, Chargeback Management	/escrow/initiate, /fraud/score, /disputes/open
e-Commerce	Buyer/Seller Verification, Escrow, Trust Badges	/user/verify, /escrow/funds, /trustbadge/get
iGaming	Enhanced KYC (age/gambling checks), Transaction Monitoring, Fraud Scoring	/kyc/agecheck, /transaction/check, /fraud/signals
3. Security Features

IP Whitelisting – Keys work only from registered IPs.

Rate Limiting – Industry-based rate caps (e.g., 1000 req/min for payments, 500 req/min for e-commerce).

Key Rotation – Automatic reminder every 90 days; instant revoke/replace option.

Usage Analytics – Dashboard shows API calls, errors, fraud detection success rate, disputes resolved, etc.

Audit Logging – All key usage logged for compliance.

4. Developer Experience

Self-Service Key Generation (post-approval).

Postman Collections & Swagger Docs auto-linked after key creation.

Code Samples in JavaScript, Python, PHP, Java, and Go for each industry.

Industry-specific SDKs preloaded with recommended configuration.

Webhooks – Real-time event notifications for KYC status changes, escrow releases, dispute updates.

5. Monetisation / Tiering

Per-Industry Pricing Models:

Fintech & Payments → Per-API call + volume discounts.

E-Commerce → Per-verification or per-transaction %.

iGaming → Per-KYC + fraud check bundle.

Usage Alerts – Email & portal notifications when approaching quota.
