3. Business Logic & Rules
Fraud Checker
Rule-1: A fraud score is generated using a weighted formula:
Database matches (40%)
Behavioural analysis (20%)
Reputation reports (20%)
Real-time anomaly detection (20%)
Rule-2: Scores are bucketed:
0–30 = Safe
31–60 = Suspicious
61–100 = High Risk
Dark Web Monitoring
Rule-3: When leaks are detected, the user receives a masked alert (e.g. jo****@gmail.com found on dark web forum).
Rule-4: Alerts must include recommended actions (password reset, bank alert, insurance claim).
Credit & Identity Monitoring
Rule-5: If an identity check is triggered, the user is notified within 1 hour.
Rule-6: Fraudulent activity must be escalated to the fraud resolution concierge automatically.
Fraud Resolution
Rule-7: Only Premium & Total plan users have access to 24/7 concierge support.
Rule-8: Standard users can download self-service dispute templates.
Insurance Add-On
Rule-9: TrustVerify earns 15–25% referral commission for every fraud insurance policy sold.
Rule-10: Insurance claims are routed directly to partner insurer APIs for processing.
Personal Fraud Score
Rule-11: Score is recalculated monthly based on:
Exposure in dark web leaks
Number of suspicious checks run
Fraud alerts from credit bureau or bank feeds
Rule-12: Scores below 40 are considered “Low Risk,” 41–70 “Medium Risk,” and 71–100 “High Risk.”
ID Vault
Rule-13: Documents are stored encrypted and accessible only with biometric authentication or multi-factor authentication.
Rule-14: Shared links expire within 24 hours and can only be opened once unless renewed
