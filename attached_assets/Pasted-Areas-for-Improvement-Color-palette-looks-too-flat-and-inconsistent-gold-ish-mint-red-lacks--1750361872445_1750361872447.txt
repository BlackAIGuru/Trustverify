Areas for Improvement:
Color palette looks too flat and inconsistent (gold-ish + mint + red = lacks harmony)

Typography needs stronger hierarchy and contrast

Spacing & alignment can be tighter and more refined

Card UI looks generic, lacking visual polish and brand personality

✨ UI/UX Enhancements (Across Pages)
1. Dashboard (Current Page)
Use card shadows or frosted glass blur for each metric block

Hover states should animate with a slight scale (1.02x) or glow using the accent color

Add tooltips or expandable cards for each metric to explain what it means (e.g. Trust Score)

Use color-coded badges or progress bars for items like verification or deals

2. Transactions Page
List view with filters: status (pending, active, disputed), date range, amount

Use color indicators or tags for fraud risk levels or transaction trustworthiness

Allow expanding transactions for more details using accordion or modal views

3. Identity Verification
Step-by-step progress indicator (e.g. Step 1: ID Upload → Step 2: Facial Scan → Done)

Use neutral colors during process, and green tones on completion

Upload success/failure indicators with animations

4. Report Scam Page
Use a form wizard (multi-step) with progress bar

Add trust badges ("Secure", "Anonymous", "Verified Response") to reassure users

UX Tip: Include example fraud cases (as light gray expandable panels) to guide users

5. General UX Tips
Top Nav Bar: Make it darker and thinner with hover glow links

Typography: Use a modern, legible font like Inter, DM Sans, or Poppins

Consistency: Apply design tokens (colors, fonts, border-radius, spacing) globally

Icons: Use a consistent icon set (e.g. Heroicons or Feather Icons)
